            Exactly the one you are accessing!<br> <br> I felt the necessity to illustrate my knowledges e present them in a didadic way, besides being a great exercise and bring along new personal challenges. As the intention of my Portfolio is, besides
            to introduce and show my knowledges, present myself as a person and developer, I made many choices by my own personal taste, for example, the blues shades, since I fell more confortable working with that color and the "Dark-Mode" with I'm
            in love with. <br><br> In this one, was only used html5, css3, Javascript e Jquery.

    <div class="imagem">

        <div class="text-smaller">
            A intern Web App to control the service orders (SO) from a Fire Equipaments company. <br><br> It turns the work flow more fluid and organized, since all data from costumer registration, SO number, products, cancellation, approval and dates
            are processed and can be edited on the website itself. Through a QR Code, a microcontroller could tell where the SO are, how much is left to end the service and with processes were already done. <br><br> During the development, I learned new
            languages and new skills, including the usage of a Css framework, PhP em general, modals, Dark Mode and assynchronous requests with Javascript/Jquery. <br><br> In this one, was used:

            <br> Front-End: html5, css3, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery.
            <br>Back-End and Databases: PhP, Python and MySQL.
            <br>microcontrollers: C/C++.
